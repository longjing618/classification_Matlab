This project is to implement and evaluate classification of Handwritten Numerals.

The training dataset is GSC features extracted from each of the image: each image is represented by a 512-bit vector, the first 192 are G (gradient), the next 192 are S (structural) and the last 128 are C (concavity).

The two classifiers are
(a) Logistic Regression (LR)
(b) Neural Network (NN)
